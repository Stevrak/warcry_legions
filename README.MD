# Warcry Card Creator 3.0 – Fighters

A fork of [@HENNIROCKS's work](https://github.com/HENNIROCKS/warcry-card-creator).

 [Stevrak](https://github.com/Stevrak/warcry-card-creator/) broke down the fighter editor into classes and components, created an image gallery, ability to load/save collection of images/cards to zip files, and a list builder.

some things are broken as they dont fit the new paradigm yet, like all the abilities, and localfiles loading/saving, so users need to use the zip archiving load/save for now.


The project was started by by @rachelnertia (https://github.com/rachelnertia/warcry-card-creator). Further development and graphics (except runemarks) by [HENNIROCKS](https://hendrik-berends.de/en). Additional work by [@dorb4n](https://github.com/dorb4n), much appreciated! Made with [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com), supporting dark and light mode. (some bootswatch functionality is a tad broken by steve) Thanks everyone!
